I believe that creating thorough design criteria for this fake system was one of my best efforts in this course.

If I could change one aspect of these documents, I would make sure that my initial UML use case diagrams contained all of the necessary use cases that the client had specified.


I carefully studied the client meeting transcript numerous times to make sure I understood the clients' expectations for the system before interpreting the user's demands and incorporating them into my system design. This stage is crucial because, no matter how well conceived or constructed a system may be, it will always fall short of the client's needs.
I start the process of producing software by carefully outlining the specifications required for the program, after which I make a list of every component I'll need to interact with. I could improve my use of project management tools like LucidChart in the future to better illustrate my UML ideas.
